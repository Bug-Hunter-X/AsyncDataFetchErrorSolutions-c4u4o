# Firebase Asynchronous Data Retrieval Error

This repository demonstrates a common error in Firebase applications related to asynchronous data fetching. The error occurs when the application attempts to access data from Firebase before the data has been fully retrieved.  This results in undefined values and potential crashes.

The `bug.js` file contains the erroneous code, while `bugSolution.js` provides the corrected version.

## Problem
The main problem is that Firebase's data retrieval operations are asynchronous. The `once('value', ...)` method doesn't immediately return the data.  Instead, it triggers a callback function once the data is available. If the code attempts to use the data before the callback is executed, it will encounter undefined values or errors.

## Solution
The solution involves ensuring that data is accessed only within the callback function, after the data has been successfully fetched from Firebase.
