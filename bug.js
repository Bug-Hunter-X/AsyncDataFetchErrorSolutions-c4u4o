The following code snippet demonstrates a Firebase error related to data retrieval and asynchronous operations.  The issue is that the data is accessed before it's fully fetched from Firebase, leading to undefined values or errors. 
```javascript
const database = firebase.database();
const ref = database.ref('path/to/data');

ref.once('value', (snapshot) => {
  const data = snapshot.val();
  console.log(data.someProperty); // Error: Cannot read properties of undefined (reading 'someProperty')
});

// ... other code that attempts to use data before it's available ...
console.log(data); //data will be undefined here
```
